# scpsl-map-seed

Generate a deterministic SCP: Secret Laboratory map from a seed, entirely offline.

## Template source

The bundled raw templates were exported with the [`SCPSL_Template_export`](https://github.com/kldhsh123/SCPSL_Template_export) exporter. That repository contains the in-game plugin/exporter used to collect atlas data, room templates, and connector metadata; this package contains the resulting offline template data and deterministic generator.

## Install a tagged GitHub version

```bash
npm install kldhsh123/scpsl-map-seed#v1.0.0
```

## API

```js
import { generateMap } from '@scpsl-tools/map-seed';

const map = generateMap(1062329959);

console.log(map.rooms);              // rooms with world/render coordinates
console.log(map.zones);              // bounds and room IDs grouped by zone
console.log(map.connectorAdjacency); // actual connector-to-connector links
```

The generator returns both the atlas cell (`room.atlasCell`) and final world-space position (`room.position`). `room.render.angleDeg` matches the sign used by the game's SCP-079 UI. `spatialAdjacency` contains deterministic four-neighbor grid adjacency, not a claim about the final connector/door prefab.

## Input

`generateMap(seed, options?)` accepts:

- `seed`: a positive signed 32-bit integer (`1` to `2147483647`), as a number or a numeric string.
- `options.holiday` (optional): `None`, `Christmas`, `Halloween`, `AprilFools`, or the corresponding numeric enum value. If omitted, the bundled template's active holiday is used.

The holiday is independent of the seed: the same seed can produce the normal, Christmas, or Halloween room prefab variants. The current `14.2.7` export was based on `None`, but it includes the Christmas and Halloween variant references. A requested holiday is applied per room where a variant exists; rooms without a variant stay on their base prefab.

```js
const normal = generateMap(seed, { holiday: 'None' });
const christmas = generateMap(seed, { holiday: 'Christmas' });
const halloween = generateMap(seed, { holiday: 'Halloween' });
```

The package already contains the templates for SCP:SL `14.2.7 Release`.

## Output

The result is a JSON-serializable `GeneratedMap`:

- `source`, `seed`, `holiday`, and `gridScale` identify the template and coordinate units.
- `rooms` is a flat list. Each room has authoritative `position`/`rotationY`, grid coordinates, room name/shape, `adjacentRoomIds`, and `connectorInstances`.
- `room.connectorInstances` contains each opening's local/world position, world rotation, cardinal `direction`, and the room IDs reached through that connector.
- `connectorAdjacency` contains the 1:1 connector links used to establish real room connections. Its `distance` is the world-space distance between the two connector points and must be within the game's threshold of `1`.
- `zones` groups room IDs and provides world Y plus zone bounds. `room.render.zonePosition` is the 180-degree-flipped 2D position used by the current preview projection.
- `spatialAdjacency` is optional analysis data for four-neighbor grid cells. It must not be rendered as a door/link because grid neighbors can have no matching connector.
- `diagnostics` reports room, connector, linked-edge, and unpaired-connector counts.

Typical rendering flow:

```js
const map = generateMap(seed);
for (const room of map.rooms) {
  drawRoom(room.render.zonePosition, room.connectorInstances);
}
for (const edge of map.connectorAdjacency) {
  drawConnection(edge.from, edge.to);
}
```

Map templates are bundled inside the tagged package. Consumers only provide a seed. The package uses the bundled template's active holiday by default.
